# BLV-2-Voron-with-my-mods-and-recommendations
This repo is inspired by the excellent work of the person: https://github.com/hammered-github on the project to turn the BLV MGN Cube into the Voron Trident: https://github.com/hammered-github/B2V.git. The goal of my project is to write everything in English and in my interpretation.
